# Maths
A Mathematics library that I wrote for learning experience. 

It was written as a personal project. I made this to learn more about c++ and maths(which I love btw).

What does this rep contains?
- Matrix 
- Some miscellaneous functions like
  - Trigonometric(sin,cos,etc).
  - Exponential  function, power function,
  - Logarithmic function.
- more to add in future

What I plan to add?
- Polynomials
- Vectors
- Graphs
- Differntial Equations (no idea how)

Currently I am working on my own graphics engine which will support all the graphical aspects of science like
- Plotting graphs,
- Geometry,
- 2D rendering,
- etc.


I plan to make this library as a mathematical library for my graphics engine.
